## You should NOT keep these tests

Problems:

* Existing behavior is captured, bugs included
* Tests will fail whenever behavior changes. Noisy!
* People will get used to _just update them_
* You can't read them to understand what the code does

**Delete them** or **have a plan to replace them** with unit tests.
