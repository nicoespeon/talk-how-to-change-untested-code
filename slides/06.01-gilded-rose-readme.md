## Let's practice: Gilded Rose kata

Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. [â€¦] Our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date.

We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us:

* All items have a `SellIn` value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
* All items have a `Quality` value which denotes how valuable the item is
* At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item

Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new category of items:

* "Conjured" items degrade in `Quality` twice as fast as normal items
