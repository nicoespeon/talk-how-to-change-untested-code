# I need to change this code, but it has no test!

Slides of my talk on approval tests.

## Things I used for this presentation

- [vscode-slides](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nicoespeon.slides), a VS Code extension to use my editor as a presentation tool
- [abracadabra](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nicoespeon.abracadabra), a VS Code extension to execute automated refactorings in JavaScript. This is how I do "Extract Variable" and "Inline Variable" during the talk.
